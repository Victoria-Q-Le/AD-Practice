What is a Tree 
    a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

Compare and contract trees and lists
    Lists - linear 
    Trees - nonlinear 

Explain the differences between trees, binary trees and binary search trees 
    Terminology:
        ROOT - The top node in the tree 
        CHILD - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root  
        Parent - The converse notion of a child
        Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent 
        Leaf - A node with no children
        Edge - The connection between one node and another 

    Use cases: 
        HTML DOM
        Network Routing 
        Abstract Syntax Tree 
        Artificial Intelligence (tic tqac toe - minimax )
        Folders in operating systems, computer file systems
        JSON
    
    Binary Trees: one parent can only have up to 2 children 

    BST 
        A binary trees whose data can be sortable (usually number), 
        Every node on the left of the parent is always less than the parent
        Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

Implement operations on binary search trees (BST)
